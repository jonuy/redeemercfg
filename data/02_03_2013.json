  "scripture_verse": "Acts 5:27-42 (NIV)",
  "scripture_body": "<p><span class='super'>27</span> Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. <span class='super'>28</span> “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man’s blood.”</p><p><span class='super'>29</span> Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than men! <span class='super'>30</span> The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead—whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. <span class='super'>31</span> God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel. <span class='super'>32</span> We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”</p><p><span class='super'>33</span> When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. <span class='super'>34</span> But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. <span class='super'>35</span> Then he addressed them: “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. <span class='super'>36</span> Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. <span class='super'>37</span> After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. <span class='super'>38</span> Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. <span class='super'>39</span> But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.”</p><p><span class='super'>40</span> His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p><p><span class='super'>41</span> The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. <span class='super'>42</span> Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.</p>",
  "goal": "To examine the twin aspects of persecution and attraction that are present in the early church.",
  "background": "<p>The book of Acts opens by showing us the enormous power and resources God gave to the church through the Holy Spirit. But by chapter 4, the early church begins to run into opposition. In the beginning of Acts 4, we see the first attack that led to Peter and John being imprisoned and released with the warning not to preach about Jesus any more. Then as Acts 5 opens, a passage we looked at last week, we have the second attack: Ananias and Sapphira falling into greed and deception. And now here, in the latter part of Acts 5, we encounter the third of these attacks, once again from the religious authorities.</p><p>In the interim between episodes two and three, the early church continued to gather regularly in the temple (v. 12) and perform miracles of healing (vv. 12, 16), while more and more people believed in the Lord and were added to the church’s number (v. 14). This activity resulted in all the apostles being jailed (v. 18), but they were miraculously rescued by an angel of the Lord (v. 19). They responded to this incident by going to the temple courts to teach the people about Jesus (v. 25).</p>",
  "question1": "<b>1. THE TEXT:</b> What is the charge made against the disciples here and how do they respond?",
  "question2": "<p><b>2. THE TEXT IN THE BIGGER STORY:</b> In v. 31, Peter and the apostles describe Jesus’ death as one where “you had [him] killed by hanging him on a tree.” This is a reference to an Old Testament law given by God to Moses in Deuteronomy 21: 22-23. What is the significance of describing Jesus’ crucifixion in this particular way?</p><div class='indented-passage'><p><span class='super'>22</span> If a man guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his body is hung on a tree, <span class='super'>23</span> you must not leave his body on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that same day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God’s curse. You must not desecrate the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.</p></div>",
  "question3": "<b>3. JESUS COMPLETING THE STORY:</b> The word “Prince” in v. 31 is a Greek word (<i>archegos</i>) that can be translated \"founder, leader or champion.\" It is pointing us to Jesus as the “hero” of our salvation. Why is it important to see Jesus as the hero of our salvation rather than just an example or guide?",
  "question4": "<b>4. LIVING OUT THE STORY:</b> What are some ways that you experience persecution as a Christian here in New York City? As we look upon Jesus as the hero of our faith, how might you respond to persecution in ways that reflect the character of the Ultimate Hero?",
