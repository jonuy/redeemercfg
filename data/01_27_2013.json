  "scripture_body": "<p><span class='super'>36</span> Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), <span class='super'>37</span> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles’feet. </p><p><span class='super'>5:1</span> Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.  <span class='super'>2</span> With his wife’s full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, ut brought the rest and put it at the apostles’ feet. </p><p><span class='super'>3</span> Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? <span class='super'>4</span> Didn’t it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn’t the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.” </p><p><span class='super'>5</span> When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. <span class='super'>6</span> Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. </p><p><span class='super'>7</span> About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <span class='super'>8</span> Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?” “Yes,” she said, “that is the price.” </p><p><span class='super'>9</span> Peter said to her, “How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? ook! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.” </p><p><span class='super'>10</span> At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <span class='super'>11</span> Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. </p><p><span class='super'>12</span> The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade. <span class='super'>13</span> No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. <span class='super'>14</span> Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.</p>",
  "goal": "To elucidate the spiritual importance of how we regard our money and possessions and to examine how an appearance of radical generosity can mask a grievous \"sin beneath the sin.\"",
  "background": "After tremendous power and growth in the early church (chs. 1-3), starting in chapter 4 - which we’ve looked at in the previous two weeks - there is an unbroken record of persecution, opposition and hostility. This hostility toward the church will continue until chapter 8. The story we will look at here is particularly unique and important because here we learn of a “threat” that emerges from within the early church.",
  "question1": "1. THE TEXT: Here in this text, we learn of two examples of generosity, that of Joseph/Barnabas and Ananias & Sapphira. In what ways are these examples of giving the same and different and what does this contrast teach us?",
  "question2": "<p>2. THE TEXT IN THE BIGGER STORY: Commentators note that Luke, the author of Acts, is drawing a parallel between this incident and the story of Achan found in Joshua 7. In what ways is Achan’s sin similar to that of Ananias and Sapphira? What do both stories reveal about God’s response to hypocrisy and deception?</p><p>Background to this text: In Joshua 5-6, the Israelites have specific instructions from God to march around Jericho so that the walls will fall down. On the seventh day, Joshua warns the Israelites to “keep away from the devoted things so that you will not bring about your own destruction … [or] make the camp of Israel liable to destruction” (6:18). They do as God says, the walls come down, and the Israelites destroy the city.</p><p><span class='super'>1</span> But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD’s anger burned against Israel…. </p><p><span class='super'>16</span> Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken. <span class='super'>17</span> The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was taken. <span class='super'>18</span> Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. <span class='super'>19</span> Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give him the praise. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” <span class='super'>20</span> Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: <span class='super'>21</span> When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.” <span class='super'>22</span> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.…</p><p><span class='super'>25</span> Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today.” Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.</p>",
  "question3": "3. JESUS COMPLETING THE STORY: How does this story about Ananias and Sapphira show us our need for a Savior in Jesus?",
  "question4": "4. LIVING OUT THE STORY: Many of us struggle to be truly authentic about who we really are regarding to our relationship to money and/or the motives behind our generosity (or lack thereof). What are some ways we tend to justify ourselves for not living (or giving) as we ought? ",
