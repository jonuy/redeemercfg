  "scripture_body":"<p>1 “Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense.”</p><p>2 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet.</p><p>Then Paul said: 3 “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I studied under Gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. 4 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, 5 as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</p><p>6 “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?’</p><p>8 “‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. “ ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ he replied. 9 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</p><p>10 “‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked.</p><p>“ ‘Get up,’ the Lord said, ‘and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.’ 11 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</p><p>12 “A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there. 13 He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that very moment I was able to see him.</p><p>14 “Then he said: ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth. 15 You will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard. 16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’</p><p>17 “When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance 18 and saw the Lord speaking to me. ‘Quick!’ he said. ‘Leave Jerusalem immediately, because the people here will not accept your testimony about me.’</p><p>19 “‘Lord,’ I replied, ‘these people know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. 20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.’</p><p>21 “Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’ ”</p><p>22 The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He’s not fit to live!”</p>",
  "goal": "To examine the love and courage needed for sharing the Christian faith with your neighbors, friends, and colleagues.",
  "background": "At the end of Acts 20, we saw Paul share an emotional farewell with church leaders in the city of Ephesus before heading over to Jerusalem with some companions. The Holy Spirit warned him twice that he would experience persecution there (Acts 20:22-23; 21:10-14). While he was at the temple, a group of Paul’s opponents from outside Judea aroused a mob to beat him and attempt to kill him. Roman troops arrived to arrest Paul and stop the uproar, and then Paul asked the commander for permission to address the crowd.",
  "question1": "1. THE TEXT: What can we learn from Paul’s example in this text about how to talk openly about the Christian faith?",
  "question2": "<p>2. THE TEXT IN THE BIGGER STORY: Read 1 Samuel 17:4-15. Here are the introductions to the two champions in one of the most famous battles in the Bible. Compare and contrast David and Goliath’s sources of courage. What do you tend to look to for a sense of confidence, courage or assurance?</p><p class='indented-passage'>4 A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His height was six cubits and a span. 5 He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; 6 on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. 7 His spear shaft was like a weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.</p><p class='indented-passage'>8 Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. 9 If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.” 10 Then the Philistine said, “This day I defy the armies of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.” 11 On hearing the Philistine’s words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.</p><p class='indented-passage'>12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul’s time he was very old. 13 Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. 14 David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, 15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.</p>",
  "question3": "3. JESUS COMPLETING THE STORY: Consider how Jesus showed his love for Paul as evidenced in his testimony. In what ways do you think reflecting on Christ’s love for him gives Paul the courage to speak to an angry mob?",
  "question4": "4. LIVING OUT THE STORY: The Apostle Paul didn’t get the results he desired from his address despite his thoughtful and civil approach. What challenges have you faced in sharing the gospel that might make (or may have made) you question the attractiveness of Christianity?",
  "prayer": [
    "Praise God that His Son still endures persecution to bring salvation to many people regardless of their hostility, apathy, religious observance or lack thereof.",
    "Confess we often care more about winning an argument or preserving our personal peace than risking rejection or appearing weak for the sake of God and our neighbor.",
    "Ask the Spirit of Christ to work in us as we help one another use our social capital to love others toward the truth."
