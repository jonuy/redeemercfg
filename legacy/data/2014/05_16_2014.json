  "goal": "To understand our unique identity as Christians and how that identity shapes the way we live in a sometimes hostile world.",
  "background": "Peter’s first letter was penned roughly 30 years after the resurrection of Jesus to predominantly Gentile Christians (though certainly also to some from Jewish backgrounds) who were living in present day Turkey and undergoing some measure of persecution for their beliefs. Peter’s letter offers encouragement and basic Christian teaching which was just the kind of thing that these young growing churches would need to hear as they sought to hold on to their new found faith and to live it out fully. In the verses before us he reminds them of the unique identity that is theirs as followers of the crucified and risen Jesus. Understanding that identity is paramount to living out their faith.",

What are the characteristics of exiles (vv. 1, 11) and why do you think Peter refers to those who were part of the early Christian church in this way?</b></p><p><b>6. (Public Faith Question) In the early Christian source “Letter to Diognetus”, a writer recounts the distinctiveness of the Christian community.</b></p><p>“For Christians are not distinguished from the rest of humanity by country, language or custom. For nowhere do they live in cities of their own, nor do they speak some unusual dialect, nor do they practice an eccentric lifestyle.... But while they live in both Greek and barbarian cities, as each one’s lot was cast, and follow the local customs in dress and food and other aspects of life, at the same time they demonstrate the remarkable and admittedly unusual character of their own citizenship.... They marry like everyone else, and have children, but they do not expose their offspring. They share their food, but not their wives. They are poor, yet they make many rich; they are in need of everything, yet they abound in everything. They are cursed, yet they bless; they are insulted, yet they offer respect.”</p><p><b>What do you find striking in this passage? Why is this distinctiveness important to our witness in the world? Which of these areas of distinctiveness do you find hardest to practice? What are some practical steps we can take to conform less to the world’s values and grow in this distinctiveness?</b></p>"
